# Reelz

The front-end for a fullstack app for creating watchlists of movies, reviewing previously watched movies, and reading movie reviews from other users. Through an external, third-party API, the user can search a database of movies and create their own reviews/ratings of movies once they're finished, which will then be stored and tracked through our database on the back-end.
